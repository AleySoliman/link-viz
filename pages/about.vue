    <p>
LinkGate is scalable web archive graph visualization. The project was launched with funding by the IIPC in January 2020. During the term of this round of funding, Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) and the national Library of New Zealand (NLNZ) partnered together to develop core functionality for a scalable graph visualization solution geared towards web archiving and to compile an inventory of research use cases to guide future development of LinkGate.
<br>
LinkGate seeks to address the need to visualize data stored in a web archive. Fundamentally, the web is a graph, where nodes are webpages and other web resources, and edges are the hyperlinks that connect web resources together. A web archive introduces the time dimension to this pool of data and makes the graph a temporal graph, where each node has multiple versions according to the time of capture. Because the web is big, web archive graph data is big data, and scalability of a visualization solution is a key concern.
